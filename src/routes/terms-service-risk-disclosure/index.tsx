            This Risk Disclosure Statement (this “Statement”) applies
            to the electronic trading platform (including any
            applicable mobile applications and websites used to access
            the same) (collectively the “Platform”) provided by
            OMcrypto Fintech Limited (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or
            “our”), and shall be deemed as part of the Service
            Agreement between the User and the Company (the “Service
            Agreement”). All capitalized terms that are used but not
            otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
            to them in the Service Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            In acceding to or using the Platform and the Site, you
            represent and warrant that you are fully aware of the
            risks associated with the transactions involving Digital
            Assets or the use of Platform. You agree and understand
            that you are solely responsible for determining the
            nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness
            of these risks for yourself, and that the Company does not
            give advice or recommendations regarding any Digital
            Asset, including the suitability and appropriateness of,
            and investment strategies for, any Digital Asset. You
            agree and understand that you access and use the Platform
            and the Site at your own risk. This brief statement does
            not disclose all of the risks associated with the Digital
            Assets and using the Platform. You should, therefore,
            carefully consider whether such use is suitable for you in
            light of your circumstances and financial resources. You
            should be aware that you may sustain a total loss of the
            Digital Assets in your Account, and that under certain
            market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible
            to liquidate a position.

          <h2>1. Risks Relating to Digital Assets</h2>
          <p>
            The price and value of any investment in Digital Asset
            products and the income, if any, from them, can fluctuate
            and may fall against your interest. An individual Digital
            Asset product may experience downward price movements and
            may under some circumstances even become valueless. An
            inherent risk of trading/investing in Digital Asset
            products is that losses may be incurred, rather than
            profits made, as a result of buying and selling such
            products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital Assets are not legal tender and are not backed by
            the government, or by commodities such as gold or silver.
            There is no central bank that can take corrective measure
            to protect the value of Bitcoin and/or Ether and/or any
            other Digital Assets in a crisis or issue more Digital
            Assets. Instead, Bitcoin, Ether and any other Digital
            Assets are autonomous and largely unregulated on worldwide
            networks. Traders put their trust in a digital,
            decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies
            on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain
            its integrity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and,
            accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental
            transactions may not be recoverable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some Digital Asset transactions shall be deemed to be made
            when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily
            the date or time that you initiated the transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value of Digital Assets may be derived from the
            continued willingness of market participants to exchange
            fiat currency or Digital Assets for Digital Assets, which
            may result in the potential for permanent and total loss
            of value of a particular Digital Asset should the market
            for that Digital Asset disappear.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk
            of fraud or cyber attack, and may mean that technological
            difficulties experienced by the Platform may prevent the
            access to or use of your Digital Assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trading of Digital Assets is susceptible to irrational (or
            rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could
            collapse demand relative to supply. For example,
            confidence might collapse in Bitcoin because of unexpected
            changes imposed by the software developers or others, a
            government crackdown, the creation of superior competing
            alternative cryptocurrencies, or a deflationary or
            inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse if the
            anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost
            or stolen, or if hackers or governments can prevent any
            transactions from settling.

            Deposits into your Account is not considered deposits
            under the applicable laws, rules, or regulations in your
            jurisdiction.

          <p>
            Digital Assets in your Account is not subject to
            applicable deposit insurance protection.

            2. Risks Relating to Derivatives, Margin and
            Security/Digital Asset Borrowing
          </h2>
          <p>
            Derivatives products carry a high degree of risk as they
            often involve gearing or leverage, so that a relatively
            small movement in the price of the underlying Digital
            Asset results in a much larger movement, favourable or
            unfavourable, in the price of the product. If the
            direction of the trade is opposite to the fluctuation of
            the market, it will cause a large loss. Depending on the
            extent of the loss, investors need to add margins or
            reduce positions, otherwise, their positions may be forced
            to liquidate, and investors must bear all the losses
            caused thereby.
          </p>
          <p>
            The risk of loss in financing a transaction by deposit of
            collateral may be significant. You may sustain losses in
            excess of your Digital Assets deposited as collateral with
            the Company. You may be called upon at short notice to
            make additional margin deposits or interest payments. If
            required margin deposit or interest payment is not made
            within the prescribed time, your collateral or positions
            may be liquidated by the Company at a loss without prior
            notification to you. You should therefore carefully
            consider whether such a financing arrangement is suitable
            in light of your own financial position and investment
            objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you borrow securities and/or Digital Assets from the
            Company, you will be required to deposit a required level
            of collateral. You may be called upon at short notice to
            place additional deposits if the level of collateral is
            inadequate in relation to the market value of borrowed
            assets. If the required deposit is not made within the
            prescribed time, the Company may buy back the borrowed
            securities and/or Digital Assets without prior
            notification to you. When you lend securities and/or
            Digital Assets to the Company, you temporarily lose legal
            ownership rights to the assets lent but in place, has a
            right to claim equivalent products.

          <h2>3. Other Risks</h2>
          <p>
            Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the
            state, federal, or international level may adversely
            affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital
            Assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither the company nor the platform is registered as a
            broker or dealer, a national securities change, a capital
            market service provider or an alternative trading system
            in any jurisdiction. The trading and settlement of the
            transactions regarding the digital assets are not
            oversight by any governmental authority or self-regulatory
            institution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Platform or the Site may become unavailable due to
            changes of applicable laws and you may suffer loss or
            incur liabilities due to the termination or suspension of
            the Platform or any or all of the Accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company’s trading facilities are supported by
            computer-based component systems for the order-routing,
            execution, matching, registration or clearing of trades.
            As with all facilities and computer systems, customers
            will be exposed to risks associated with the systems
            including the failure of hardware and software. The result
            of any system failure may be that your order is either not
            executed according to instructions or is not executed at
            all. You should also be aware that the Internet is not a
            completely reliable transmission medium and there may be
            delays in service provisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should note in particular that the proceeds from the
            sale of Digital Assets and other income may be or may
            become subject to tax, levies, duties or other fees or
            charges imposed by the authorities in that market,
            including taxation levied by withholding at source. Tax
            law and practice regarding Digital Assets in certain
            countries may not be clearly established. It is therefore
            possible that the current interpretation of the law or
            understanding of practice may change, or that the law may
            be changed with retrospective effect.
