        <h2>7. Account</h2>

        <p>
          7.1 In order to use the services on the Platform, you must
          create an account with the Platform (the “Account”). The
          Account will be used to record various Digital Assets
          transferred by you onto the Platform and conduct
          transactions on the Platform. The Account may be registered
          by any individual who is over 18 years old or an institution
          by its duly authorized representatives, provided such
          individual and institution have read and understand the Risk
          Disclosure Statements , which is incorporated by reference
          into, and shall be a part of this Agreement. Each User shall
          only register one trading Account on the Platform.
          Registration of multiple trading Accounts would be a
          violation of these Terms and may lead to immediate
          termination of these Terms and the Accounts involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.2 The Account is not a bank account and the Digital Assets
          held in the Account are not deposits or other financial
          products. Except as otherwise permitted by the Platform, no
          interest will be paid on any funds or Digital Assets under
          your Account, and all Digital Assets that are directly held
          by us for your benefit are not insured by any Governmental
          Authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.3 You may fund the Account by transferring Digital Assets
          from your accounts with third parties into the Account. No
          fees are charged by the Platform for funding the Account;
          however, third parties, such as your bank, may charge
          transaction and other fees. The Digital Assets will be
          transferred to the Platform’s address for omnibus user
          account. The Platform will then credit your Account with
          such amount of Digital Assets on the Platform’s ledger.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.4 You may withdraw all or some of the Digital Assets under
          your name recorded on the Platform’s ledger. There is no
          minimum amount of Digital Assets required to maintain your
          status as a User. Digital assets will be transferred from
          the omnibus user account held by the Platform to the
          specific Digital Assets address provided by you. Withdrawals
          may take up to three (3) days to complete, provided that
          larger withdrawals may take up to thirty (30) days to
          complete and that any withdrawal may be delayed as necessary
          to comply with Applicable Law and/or the Platform’s User
          Identification Policy.
        </p>
        <h2>8.Trading</h2>

        <p>
          8.1 The Platform is a marketplace that allows you to place
          orders and facilitates the order matching and settlement of
          the purchase or sale of Digital Assets or its derivatives
          with other Users. The Platform simply matches purchase and
          sale orders put forth by Users and assists Users with
          carrying out their intent as expressed via the orders.
          Except as expressly specified otherwise in this Agreement,
          neither the Company nor the Platform is acting as a
          principle in or other participants in those transactions.
          Neither the Company nor the Platform is responsible for any
          disputes among or between Users regarding any transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2 Matching Orders are automatically paired by the Platform
          through its proprietary software and models, and the
          Platform will notify the respective Users that the order has
          been executed. Once a match is made, the order is executed
          and cleared instantaneously. YOU SHOULD ONLY PLACE AN ORDER
          IF YOU FULLY INTEND TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION. You have
          the right to stop a pre-authorized order by initiating
          procedures through your Account to effectuate closure of
          such open order.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.3 Unless otherwise permitted by the Platform, you may only
          sell such amount of Digital Assets as does not exceed the
          total amount of Digital Assets held in your Account and
          recorded in the Platform ledger, plus the applicable
          Transaction Fee (as defined below). Any attempt by you to
          sell more Digital Assets than the Platform records show
          exists in your Account after deduction of the applicable
          Transaction Fee will result in an unsuccessful trade and may
          be grounds for termination of the Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.4 You acknowledge that you may not be possible in all
          circumstances to cancel or modify an order, even before the
          order is matched or executed. We accept no responsibility
          for ensuring that an order is modified or canceled and you
          understand and agree that, if the order cannot be canceled
          or modified, you are bound by any execution of the original
          order. You further acknowledge that attempts to modify or
          cancel and replace an order may result in over-execution or
          the execution of duplicate orders, and you shall be
          responsible for all such executions.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.5 You shall be deemed to have given orders through the
          Platform when we acknowledge such orders through the
          Platform or by such other means as we may determine (whether
          or not you actually receive or become aware of such
          acknowledgment). You understand that the Platform provides
          the ability to show the real-time status of all of your open
          orders and pending instructions. You further understand that
          it is your responsibility to monitor your open orders and
          pending instructions in real-time until the Platform
          acknowledges the full execution, cancellation or rejection
          of the orders or instructions and that we assume no
          responsibility or liability if you fail to do so. In the
          event that you fail to immediately notify us of any error in
          the real-time acknowledgment of the status of any of your
          open orders or pending instructions, including the
          Platform’s failure to promptly acknowledge the receipt of an
          order after you transmit such order, we reserve the right to
          exercise in good faith discretion to require you to accept
          the trade or to remove the trade from your Account at your
          sole benefit or loss. We may, in some cases, and at our sole
          discretion, require secondary electronic, verbal, written or
          other confirmation before acting if your Account activity is
          outside of its normal range of activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.6 Your orders shall be subject to trading limits that we
          may establish, revise and communicate to you from time to
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.7 Subject to Section 8.10, once an order has been
          executed, the transaction may not be reversible.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.8 You acknowledge that, due to technical and other
          restrictions, the price of Digital Assets displayed on the
          Site may be delayed and therefore not reflect the current,
          live market value of such digital asset. Nonetheless, you
          agree that the prices displayed on the Site control the
          value of your Account and your use of the Platform and Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.9 You acknowledge and agree that the Platform cannot and
          does not warrant or guarantee that any Order placed through
          the Platform will be executed at the best posted price.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.10 Absent mutual consent of parties involved, we reserve
          the right to cancel or nullify trades in the event that:

          17.3 You must promptly inform us of all changes, including,

          we or any of our authorized agents have reasonable grounds
          to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not

          terminate the Account and refuse any and all current or
          future use of the Platform and Site by you, as well as
          subject you to civil liability or refer you to the
          appropriate law enforcement authorities for criminal
          prosecution. We shall not be liable to make any

          17.4 You shall comply with any reasonable requests by us for

        </p>
        <p>
          17.5 Please note that we may collect information using
          tracking technologies regarding your device, such as IP
          address, network provider, mobile carrier, mobile browser
          type, timestamp, time zone, information about the speed,
          bearing, orientation, and altitude of a device, or other
          device identifying information. The User consents to such
          use of tracking technologies and acknowledges that the
          information obtained, including Personal Information, may be
          matched to public or private information accessible to the
          Company or any Third-Party Services Provider. The User also
          consents to such information being shared with the Company’s
          and Third-Party Services Provider’s service providers for
          the purposes of providing and maintaining the tracking
          technologies and related services. We may also collect
          precise geolocation data from or about your device, which
          may be expressed by latitude-longitude coordinates obtained
          through GPS tools, WiFi data, cell tower triangulation or
          other techniques. Our use of such information is described
          in our Privacy Policy.

        <h2>18. Market Makers</h2>
        <p>
          18.1 We may engage one or more market makers, who may also
          be affiliated with us, to act as liquidity providers on the
          Platform. You understand and agree that such market makers
          may be entitled to terms or rates that are preferential to
          you due to the services they offer.
        </p>
        <h2>19. Insurance Fund; Auto-Deleverage (ADL)</h2>
        <p>
          19.1 The Company maintains an insurance fund to cover the
          excessive losses caused by liquidated positions that are
          closed at worse than bankruptcy prices. The insurance fund
          is collected from the residual margin of liquidated
          positions that are closed at better than bankruptcy prices.
          The current balance of the insurance fund will be displayed
          on the Platform’s “Daily Insurance Fund Balance” page.
        </p>
        <p>
          19.2 In extreme market conditions, however, if a position
          loss during a certain period of time has depleted the
          insurance fund, you agree that the Platform shall
          automatically deleverage the opposing position from the
          Users with the highest ADL ranking at the bankruptcy price
          of the liquidated order. In such circumstances, Users with
          the highest ADL ranking will get their winning positions
          partially or fully closed, depending on the size of the
          liquidated position, to cover for other Users’ margin
          deficit. You may be able to find your ADL ranking on the
          Platform. The ADL ranking is assigned by the Platform based
          on your leverage and your positions’ profit ratio.
